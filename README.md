## Haste.Heart Code Challenge

**NOTE:** This project uses [VSCode Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for local development.

The initial `docker build` takes 105.5s. Once launched run the command `task` to start `terratest` for all three parts of the code challenge; which takes 1m35s.
